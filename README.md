# Snail Maze 3D Plus
A neverending procedurally-generated first-person maze-solving/horror game inspired by the 1986 Sega Master System classic Snail Maze. Try to solve as many mazes as you can all the while being hunted by a deceptively quick and eternally hungry giant snail. Built using a custom-made software renderer that uses DDA raycasting and Painter's algorithm to deliver Wolfenstein 3D-esque visuals. Originally developed 01/2023.
